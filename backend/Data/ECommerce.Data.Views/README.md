# ECommerce.Data.Views

**Purpose:** Database view DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)

## 📋 Overview

This project contains C# classes that represent database views. These are auto-generated by **LLBLGen Pro** when the database engineer creates views.

## 🎯 How It Works

### Database Engineer Creates View:
1. Backend Developer requests a view (e.g., "I need a ProductListView with id, name, price, category")
2. Database Engineer creates SQL view in migration
3. Database Engineer runs LLBLGen Pro Designer
4. LLBLGen generates view DTO classes in this project

### Example View DTO:
```csharp
namespace ECommerce.Data.Views
{
    [Serializable]
    [DataContract]
    public partial class ProductListView
    {
        [DataMember]
        public int Id { get; set; }
        
        [DataMember]
        public string NameEn { get; set; }
        
        [DataMember]
        public decimal Price { get; set; }
        
        [DataMember]
        public string CategoryNameEn { get; set; }
    }
}
```

## 📝 Current Views

*Views will be added here as requested by Backend Developer*

### Requested Views:
- (None yet - waiting for backend developer requests)

### Created Views:
- (None yet)

## 🔧 How to Request a View

**Backend Developer:** Create an issue or comment with:
```markdown
**View Name:** ProductDetailsView
**Purpose:** Full product info for detail page
**Fields Needed:**
- product_id
- name_en, name_ar
- description_en, description_ar
- price, cost_price
- stock_quantity
- category_name_en, category_name_ar
- rating (average from reviews)
- review_count
- image_url (primary image)
```

**Database Engineer** will then:
1. Create the view in a migration
2. Run migrations
3. Generate DTO in this project using LLBLGen Pro
4. Notify backend developer when ready
